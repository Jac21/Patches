<p>Previewing a sample or a recording while on a MIDI track is now possible by letting it be previewed on the neighboring audio track.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

<p>It was not possible to access Quick mutes and activate FILL mode when in GRID RECORDING mode. </p>

<h2 id="list-of-changes-from-os-140a-to-140b">List of changes from OS 1.40A to 1.40B</h2>

<h3 id="bug-fixes-2">Bug fixes</h3>

<p>It wasn't possible to revert the changes made with the control all function.</p>

<h2 id="list-of-changes-from-os-140-to-140a">List of changes from OS 1.40 to 1.40A</h2>

<h3 id="improvements-2">Improvements</h3>

<p>Saving a song to a project now works the same as saving a pattern to a project. After using <strong>SAVE TO PROJ</strong> in the SONG menu, the song is saved without needing to save the project afterward. However, the project needs to be saved before switching to another project to retain the changes.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes-3">Bug fixes</h3>

<p>Latching FILL mode did not work.</p>

<p>The playhead (the red LED moving on the TRIG keys when the sequencer is running) was not visible when in KEYBOARD mode.</p>

<p>The MASTER parameter page always reverted to page 1/3 when switching track.</p>

<p>In SONG mode, queuing a pattern to play after the song is complete while a song row is repeating was ignored and instead the pattern playing on the song row kept playing after the song ended.</p>

<p>In SONG mode, if a song row was set to loop indefinitely, queuing another row to play did not have any effect since it was not prioritized over playing the indefinitely looping row. </p>

<p>In SONG mode, the swing setting from a queued song could be carried over and affect the currently playing song. </p>

<p>The graphical keyboard only indicated one pressed black key at a time even if multiple black keys were pressed.</p>

<p>The PATTERN menu could under some circumstances be accessed by pressing <strong>[FUNC]</strong>+<strong>[SONG MODE]</strong>. </p>

<p>Keyboard mode could in some cases unexpectedly change to GRID RECORDING mode when switching tracks.</p>

<h2 id="list-of-changes-from-os-130b-to-140">List of changes from OS 1.30B to 1.40</h2>

<h3 id="improvements-3">Improvements</h3>

<p>Added multi-track recording functionality in STEP RECORDING mode.</p>

<p>Added a GLOBAL FX/MIX menu item in the SETTINGS menu. In the GLOBAL FX/MIX menu, you have the option to set the parameters on the DELAY, REVERB, COMPRESSOR, INTERNAL MIXER, and EXTERNAL MIXER parameter pages to be global (making any change to these parameters affect all patterns in the project and not only the active pattern).</p>

<p>Implemented an intensity setting for the LEDs and OLED screen. The option is located in the SYSTEM menu.</p>

<p>Added an option for the device to remember which of a PARAMETER page's subpage you last used and access this page again next time you press the same <strong>[PARAMETER]</strong> key.</p>

<h3 id="improvements-5">Improvements</h3>

<p>Added Overbridge support for macOS Big Sur.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes-6">Bug fixes</h3>

<p>The first trig in the pattern was sometimes not triggered when controlling the Elektron device with an external MIDI clock, and MIDI transport was started.</p>

<p>Only the start of the chain was visible on screen when creating a new pattern chain.</p>

<p>Some special characters were not shown when used in a pattern name.</p>

<p>SysEx dumps could become corrupted when sent to certain computer software.</p>

<p>The chromatic keyboard now has an extended octave range when a MIDI
track is active.</p>

<p>General performance optimizations. Time-consuming operations such as loading
 / saving samples and projects are now faster.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes-15">Bug fixes</h3>

<p>The unit would sometimes crash when attempting to save the project via the 
<em>FUNC</em> + <em>SAVE PPROJ</em> key combination.</p>

<p>In some rare situations, the unit could crash while loading/deleting/moving
samples.</p>

<p>Pattern / Bank selection could not be accessed when in Chromatic mode.</p>

<p>Playing the higest possible chromatic note (+24 semitones) on an audio track 
via MIDI would cause a hanging note.</p>

<p>If the MIDI Output CH setting was set to Trk Ch, the trig keys would
incorrectly send notes to MIDI channel 1, regardless of the configured track
channels.</p>

<p>If a sample was loaded to more than one slot, only the first slot would have 
the correct sample length.</p>

<h2 id="list-of-changes-from-os-102-to-103">List of changes from OS 1.02 to 1.03</h2>

<h3 id="changes-2">Changes</h3>

<p>Updated factory presets. In total there are now 32 patterns and 64 sounds. To 
install the factory presets you must perform a <em>Factory Reset</em>.
<strong>WARNING:</strong> Factory reset overwrites Sound Bank A and Project 001.</p>

<p>Metronome can be disabled/enabled using Func+PTN long press.</p>

<p>Help text is shown when attempting to change a disabled MIDI parameter.</p>

<p>Help text is shown when switching mute modes.</p>

<p>The shortcut operations for saving/reloading patterns have been changed so they
don't apply to the saved plus drive project. In order to save patterns to (or 
reload ditto from) the plus drive project you must now use the pattern menu. 
This means you can use the quick save/reload operations to work with the 
pattern in a way that's not destructive for the saved project. The operations 
will now also work for unsaved and write-protected projects.</p>

<p>New default MIDI settings for new projects: USB output is enabled and parameter
output is set to CC.</p>

<p>Active mute mode (global vs pattern) is now remembered, so that both the mute 
mode and the quick mute mode shows last visible mode instead of always 
defaulting to global mutes.</p>

<p>Write-protected samples are now marked with a padlock in the sample manager.</p>

<p>On/off switch-type trig parameters retain their names on screen when parameter 
locking. Were previously replaced by the text on or off.</p>

<p>Improved bank selection mode.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes-16">Bug fixes</h3>

<p>Exception error when loading/deleting/moving samples.</p>

<p>FX Settings not remembered after reboot.</p>

<p>FX settings not applied correctly after pattern reload</p>

<p>Track levels not applied after pattern reload.</p>

<p>Having any MIDI track active causes internal tracks to ignore external MIDI 
notes.</p>

<p>Changing to a Pattern in a different Bank while playing displays incorrectly.</p>

<p>Pattern selection would go away before PTN button was released.</p>

<p>Project sub-menus not restored properly when toggling settings menu.</p>

<p>Not possible to edit or record trigs via USB MIDI auto channel.</p>

<p>Pattern paste and pattern reload wouldn't update tempo.</p>

<p>Clearing the trig page would incorrectly reset the note length.</p>

<p>Zooming on the recorder screen could cause big delays when saving the sample.</p>

<p>MIDI transport input ignored its designated setting, and would be received or 
not depending on whether clock input was enabled.</p>

<p>Applying minimum trim in the recorder screen would make the unit freeze.</p>

<p>Power cycling the unit would preserve the currently active global mutes, with 
one exception: if track 16 was muted, all tracks were unmuted after a power 
cycle.</p>

<p>Some messages in the sample manager would not be displayed.</p>

<p>It was not possible to clear MIDI note locks using trig key + play/clear.</p>

<p>Pressing TRK would not close pattern change mode.</p>

<p>Pattern selection mode would exit once a pattern had been selected, even though
the PTN key was still being pressed.</p>

<p>Mute mode could not be opened when in step recording mode.</p>

<p>Pattern mute on MIDI Track would not engage until next pattern loop, or until 
the second run of a pattern when changing pattern while the sequencer is 
stopped.</p>

<p>The unit would hang very easily if there were any trigs on the MIDI tracks and 
if transport mode was changed quickly a few times in a row.</p>

<h2 id="list-of-changes-from-os-101-to-102">List of changes from OS 1.01 to 1.02</h2>

<h3 id="changes-3">Changes</h3>

<p>Improved metronome menu.</p>

<p>Improved quantization menu.</p>

<p>Recorded sample trim is automatically reset after saving.</p>

<p>Added possibility to reset recorded sample trim using the NO key.</p>

<p>Reversed recorder zoom knob direction.</p>

<p>Added graphical representation of reverb shelving filter.</p>

<p>Added graphical representation of reverb and delay HP- and LP-filters.</p>

<p>Improved simulation of encoder detention.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes-17">Bug fixes</h3>

<p>Last note in the external MIDI chromatic keyboard range was not playable.</p>

<p>The mapped drum octave on external MIDI was too wide, triggering not 8 audio 
tracks, but also incorrectly triggering the first 4 MIDI tracks.</p>

<p>External MIDI could not be used to enter notes into the sequencer.</p>

<p>Having any MIDI track active caused internal tracks to ignore external MIDI 
notes.</p>

<p>Unit would sometimes crash when synced to external MIDI clock.</p>

<p>MIDI Notes were not cleared from trig when removing trig.</p>

<p>MIDI Note2..4 were not included in copy/paste trigs, nor when rotating a track,
nor with scale page copy/paste/clear.</p>

<p>It was not possible to record chords into the MIDI sequencer via Chromatic Mode
or external MIDI when live recording.</p>

<h2 id="list-of-changes-from-os-100-to-101">List of changes from OS 1.00 to 1.01</h2>

<p>Graphical amplitude envelope added to amp page.</p>

<p>Graphical filter envelope and filter response plot added to filter page.</p>

<p>Graphical MIDI note keyboard added to the MIDI trig page.</p>

<p>The export sound operation no longer prompts for which track sound to use. It 
just uses the currently active track. </p>

<p>Func+yes can be used to preview sounds (using the active track) in the sound 
browser.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes-18">Bug fixes</h3>

<p>Sample file association was not saved with sound, unless the slot parameter was
updated after the sample was loaded.</p>

<p>Sample loop position parameter had the wrong upper limit. Corrected to 120.</p>

<p>Sound tag editor responded very slowly to input and did not use full screen.</p>

<p>LFO trig flag was not enabled by default in new project.</p>

<p>The clear kit option in the pattern menu would actually clear the sequence.</p>

<p>No note-off was sent for infinite length MIDI notes when pressing stop.</p>

<p>Entering MIDI notes outside of the valid range (0...127) using offsets would 
result in undefined behavior.</p>

<p>Showing all the parameter values of pages delay, reverb, and master by 
pressing and holding func+page key did not work.</p>
